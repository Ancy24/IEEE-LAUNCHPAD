### About Me

I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a passion for upskilling and hands-on innovation. I love exploring new ideas, solving real-world problems, and collab with others who share the same drive for creativity.  I thrive in focused environments where I can think critically, collaborate meaningfully, and contribute through action rather than words alone.
My leadership journey helped me discover my interest in guiding and supporting others. Since then, I’ve continued to take initiative in group projects, helping bring out the best in my peers while staying committed to learning and innovation.
I’m especially interested in working on practical, solution-driven projects and I aspire to contribute to the community, one thoughtful step at a time.


#### Leadership and Influence:

As an Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a deep-rooted passion for problem-solving, I have consistently sought opportunities to lead through action, ideas, and collaboration—even as an introvert. My leadership journey began in school, where I served as a prefect. This role helped me step out of my comfort zone, manage responsibilities, and guide my peers with empathy and discipline, laying a strong foundation for leadership rooted in responsibility and communication.

#### Networking:

I am a person deeply driven to connect through shared interests, collaboration, and purposeful communication. My approach to networking focuses on building genuine, value-driven relationships—whether it's by contributing to technical discussions, assisting my friends with problem-solving, or participating in workshops and tech events where innovation and learning take center stage.
During my time as a school prefect, I learned the importance of listening and leading with empathy—skills I now apply to academic teamwork. I often take the initiative to bring together team members with complementary strengths, ensuring a supportive environment where ideas are respected and developed collectively.
To further engage with the broader engineering community, I plan to increase my involvement in professional networks like IEEE, and research communities.

#### Career Plan:

As an Electronics and Communication Engineering student, I believe that meaningful impact can begin with quiet, consistent action. I aim to contribute to the Kerala Startup Ecosystem by leveraging my technical skills, collaborative mindset, and interest in leadership in both the short and long term.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala can excel by fostering stronger collaboration between academia and startups, encouraging student-led innovation, and focusing on solving local problems with global potential. Supportive government initiatives like Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), combined with mentorship, funding, and access to tech infrastructure, can accelerate growth. By building inclusive communities that support both bold entrepreneurs and quiet problem-solvers, Kerala can create a sustainable and impactful tech startup ecosystem.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

I have not made any Open source contributions so far.

#### History of Community Engagement:

As highly curious Electronics and Communication Engineering student, I’ve always been drawn to technical communities where I can learn, share, and grow at my own pace. While I may not always be vocal in large group settings, I’ve found meaningful ways to contribute to and engage in the community online.
I regularly explore and learn from platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub, where I occasionally contribute by answering beginner-level questions, especially related to electronics, embedded systems, and basic programming logic. These platforms have helped me build my own knowledge base and support others facing similar challenges.
In addition, I’m part of a few Discord and WhatsApp groups focused on electronics and tech innovation at my college level. Within these spaces, I actively participate by sharing resources and discussing project ideas. These communities have become valuable places where I engage in quiet but meaningful collaboration.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

I haven't developed any visible technical blog posts, articles, or video series. 

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

I have not comeup with any software tools to date.
